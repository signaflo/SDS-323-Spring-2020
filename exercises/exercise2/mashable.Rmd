# Becoming "Viral"
Mashable currently has about 49% of its articles go "viral," or get shared more than 1,400 times. Is there any way to improve this, or is it completely random?

There are several factors that can be considered. These include, but are not limited to, the subject matter (e.g., "Entertainment", "World", "Tech"), day of publication, and polarity of the words in the article's content and title.
 
A comprehensive overview of mean numeric data used in this analysis is summarized in the table below. The variable "url" was omitted for concision.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# head(arti) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
# summarize_all(arti, list(~mean(.)))
arti %>% summarize_if(is.numeric, mean)%>% round(3)%>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```
# KNN Regression Approach
We fit a linear regression model to predict the number of times an article was shared using several variables, including the number of words in the title, number of links (in general and to other Mashable articles), subject matter, and average negative polarity of the article. These variables were selected based upon their statistical significance in a regression with all of the variables in the dataset used to predict number of shares.

On a more intuitive level, ___________________.
```{r echo = FALSE}

rmse = function(y, ypred) {
  sqrt(mean(data.matrix((y-ypred)^2)))
}

```
Below are the different values of K tested to find the optimal K for the out-of-sample accuracy.

```{r echo = FALSE}

# confusion matrix - make a table of KNN (regular, not classification) errors
k_grid <- exp(seq(log(1), log(100), length=30)) %>% round %>% unique
k_grid <- k_grid[k_grid != 2]
# k_grid <- k_grid[k_grid %% 2 != 0]
k_grid
```
Iterating across the above range of K to find the best out-of-sample accuracy rate, we find that the best K value is when K = 4. A potential reason for why averaging 4 points yields the best out-of-sample accuracy despite such a large dataset (almost 40,000 observations) is  
```{r echo = FALSE}
# create a confusion matrix for multiple K values

The true positive rate (percentage of Viral that are correctly identified) is shown below.
```{r echo = FALSE}

The true negative rate (percentage of Nonviral that are correctly identified) is shown below.
```{r echo = FALSE}

TN = avg_conf_mat[1,1] / sum(avg_conf_mat[,1])

The false positive rate (percentage of Viral incorrectly identified as Nonviral) is shown below.
```{r echo = FALSE}
# There are --% of Viral incorrectly identified as Nonviral 
FP = avg_conf_mat[2,1] / sum(avg_conf_mat[,1])
FP
```

The false negative rate (percentage of NonViral incorrectly identified as Viral) is shown below.
```{r echo = FALSE}
# There are --% of NonViral incorrectly identified as Viral 
FN = avg_conf_mat[1,2] / sum(avg_conf_mat[,2])
FN
```

In contrast, the null model, which always predicts that an article will not be viral, has an out-of-sample accuracy rate of 0.5065584. The above KNN regression model has a slightly higher out-of-sample accuracy rate; however, it is inherently difficult to predict whether an article will go viral, so this number is still relatively low.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# null model, always predicts "not viral"
lm_lame = lm(!viral ~ 1, data = arti)

# do the TP for null
coef(lm_lame)
# do false negative
## debug
# nonviral in real?
```
# KNN Classification Approach

Approaching the problem from where the dependent variable is a binary, or dummy, variable, rather than a numerical variable, yields different results. The dummy variable "Viral" is 1 when the number of shares is greater than 1400.

# Comparing Approach Performance
The KNN regression approach (regress first and threshold second) had an out-of-sample accuracy rate of around 0.532, whereas the KNN classification approach (threshold first and regress/classify second) had about 0.556 accuracy out-of-sample.

<!-- The KNN regression method has a smaller optimal K value where the error is lowest (K = 4), as opposed to the KNN classification method which has an optimal K that is much higher. -->

The difference between these numbers varies when using different train-test splits.
