## Purpose

A Layered Grammar of Graphics is a paper by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham that gives some
background describing why the package and its functions operate as they do.

## Introduction

"The most important modern work in graphical grammars is “The Grammar of Graphics” by Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005)."
